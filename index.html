        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I was born and raised a military brat. I grew up in multiple states
          throughout my childhood and went to high school in Las Vegas and Naples
          Italy. I went on a mission to India after high school and came home
          early for COVID-19 before going to BYU in the fall of 2020. I married my
          beautiful wife in 2021 and we got a cute little puppy named Winston just
          this past summer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially I was going to do Computer Engineering, but after a couple
          classes I realized my interest and talents were in pure programming.
          I switched to Computer Science and haven't looked back. I'm currently
          a Junior and am almost done with all my CS classes. I'm working at Learning
          Suite as a web developer, so I like the structure this class gives to
          what I've taught myself at work.
